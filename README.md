This repository contains the implementation of a Radix-4 Bit Multiplier using Verilog HDL. The Radix-4 algorithm is an efficient method for multiplying binary numbers, significantly reducing the number of partial products and addition operations compared to traditional multiplication methods. 
This project is particularly useful for applications requiring high-speed arithmetic operations in digital circuits
